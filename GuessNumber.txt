Output:

Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 55
Too high. Try again!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 40
Too high. Try again!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 30
Too high. Try again!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 10
Too low. Try again!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 15
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 5 attempts.

This C++ program is similar to the C version but uses std::cout for output and std::cin for input. The logic and flow of the program remain the same. The srand(time(0)) line is used to seed the random number generator based on the current time, ensuring a different random number each time the program runs. The program then enters a loop where the user is prompted to guess the number, and feedback is provided based on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.
